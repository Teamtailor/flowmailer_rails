# FlowmailerRails
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/flowmailer_rails.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/flowmailer_rails)
![Tests](https://github.com/teamtailor/flowmailer_rails/workflows/Ruby/badge.svg)

Send ActionMailer emails with Flowmailer

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'flowmailer_rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

### Configuration

Add basic configuration by providing it with your account id and client Id and Secret for an API source with submitt access.
```ruby
# config/production.rb
config.action_mailer.flowmailer_settings = {
  account_id: ENV["FLOWMAILER_ACCOUNT_ID"],
  client_id: ENV["FLOWMAILER_CLIENT_ID"],
  client_secret: ENV["FLOWMAILER_CLIENT_SECRET"],
}
```

You can also provide procs that handles the `access_token` retrieval if you already have that logic in your Rails app:
```ruby
# config/production.rb
config.action_mailer.flowmailer_settings = {
  account_id: ENV["FLOWMAILER_ACCOUNT_ID"],
  access_token: -> { FooBar.access_token },
  fetch_new_access_token: -> { FooBar.fetch_new_access_token },
}
```

Tell Rails to use Flowmailer as the delivery method

```ruby
# config/production.rb
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :flowmailer
```
## Development
